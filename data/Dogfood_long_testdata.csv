1,bibita_051,Royal Canin Medium Adult 7+,Royal Canin Medium Adult 7+ has been formulated to answer the needs of mature medium-sized breed dogs (11 - 25 kg) from 7 years. The food has a specially adapted texture; shape and size of kibble as well as selected nutrients to ensure it is well accepted. The recipe of this dry food has been designed to combat the first signs of ageing. As your dog ages it can become more sluggish and its digestion becomes more sensitive. Dogs over the age of 7 can be more susceptible to infections and illness; as their immune defences weaken as they get older. The appearance of their skin and coat can also look less healthy as they age; and they may develop dental problems associated with tartar build up.Medium sized dogs can be family dogs living a quiet life; but can also be engaged in sporting activities (e.g. gun dogs).  Following the feeding guidelines for a measured food intake can prevent excess weight gain in less active dogs; or provide the additional calories needed for peak performance in sporting or hunting dogs.  Royal Canin Medium Adult 7+ dog food at a glance: High acceptance: carefully selected nutrients; adapted texture; shape and size of kibble Skin and coat protection: omega-6 fatty acids and gamma-linoleic acid from borage oil promote a shiny coat; the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA support skin healthTartar reduction: sodium tripolyphosphates bind salivary calcium and thus limit its contribution to the development of tartarRoyal Canin Medium Adult 7+ dog food with healthy ageing label contributes to active cell protection: A special antioxidant complex (vitamins E and A; polyphenols) may protect cells from free radicals and thus helps to slow down the ageing processReduced phosphorus content supports kidney functionsAn adapted protein content (25%) helps to maintain muscle massKibble:,39.99,megapet_070,Royal Canin Medium Adult Dog 7+ 15kg Dry Dog Food,Hill's Science Plan Adult Advanced Fitness Medium - Tuna & Rice has been specially developed to meet the energy demands and nutritional needs of active and athletic dogs.
