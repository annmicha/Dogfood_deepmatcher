If you own a pug; you know that the breed makes a happy and lively companion. These dignified; contented little dogs also show a lot of courage and dignity. Their courage means that they can find it difficult to interpret signs of aggression in other dogs and underestimate danger. Its gentle nature makes the pug the perfect dog to keep with other pets. Pugs are prone to gaining excess weight; so it is important that you feed your dog a healthy; balanced diet. Their physiology; with short jaws (brachycephalic type); gives them narrowed airways; so they often have difficulty breathing and that can have a knock-on effect on their eating habits. Feeding can be difficult; so pugs need a special kibble that is easy to eat and encourages chewing.Royal Canin Breed Pug Adult was developed with the special requirements of pugs from 10 months in mind:Maintaining ideal weight: high-quality proteins and an increased amount of L-carnitine can help dogs with a tendency to put on too many pounds to keep their ideal weightOptimal food intake: a special kibble makes feeding easier and encourages intensive chewingSkin health and coat care: fish oil; vitamin A; borage oil; chelated zinc and a special skin nutrient complex strengthen the skin's barrier function and maintain the natural beauty of the coatSlowing down the ageing process: a select complex of anti-oxidants (vitamins E and C and polyphenols) can help to protect cells against free radicalsKibble:,16.49

0,bibita_377,Royal Canin Dachshund Adult,The Dachshund; also known as sausage dog; is a spirited dog and an excellent hunter. The dachshund owes his popularity on all five continents to his characteristic silhouette with short; bent limbs (chondrodystrophic type).

However this causes the Dachshund to have especially sensitive joints.Dachshunds have a one of longest life expectancies of any dog. However; the restful lifestyle of your dachshund can accelerate oxidative stress and the related cell ageing process that follows. It is important that the nutrition of your Dachshund limits the effect of oxidative stress and ensures healthy digestion for as long as possible.Dachshunds often have a natural tendency to become overweight. Obesity can overburden your pet's sensitive back bone; which can lead to grave consequences.Royal CaninBreed Dachshund Dog Food was specially developed with aforementioned characteristics in mind.Joint Protection:Royal Canin Breed Dachshund Dog Food helps protect your loved one's joints due to its chondroitin and glucoasmine as well as a high component of EPA/DHA fatty acids.

0,bibita_051,Royal Canin Medium Adult 7+,Royal Canin Medium Adult 7+ has been formulated to answer the needs of mature medium-sized breed dogs (11 - 25 kg) from 7 years. The food has a specially adapted texture; shape and size of kibble as well as selected nutrients to ensure it is well accepted. The recipe of this dry food has been designed to combat the first signs of ageing. As your dog ages it can become more sluggish and its digestion becomes more sensitive. Dogs over the age of 7 can be more susceptible to infections and illness; as their immune defences weaken as they get older. The appearance of their skin and coat can also look less healthy as they age; and they may develop dental problems associated with tartar build up.Medium sized dogs can be family dogs living a quiet life; but can also be engaged in sporting activities (e.g. gun dogs).  Following the feeding guidelines for a measured food intake can prevent excess weight gain in less active dogs; or provide the additional calories needed for peak performance in sporting or hunting dogs.  Royal Canin Medium Adult 7+ dog food at a glance: High acceptance: carefully selected nutrients; adapted texture; shape and size of kibble Skin and coat protection: omega-6 fatty acids and gamma-linoleic acid from borage oil promote a shiny coat; the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA support skin healthTartar reduction: sodium tripolyphosphates bind salivary calcium and thus limit its contribution to the development of tartarRoyal Canin Medium Adult 7+ dog food with healthy ageing label contributes to active cell protection: A special antioxidant complex (vitamins E and A; polyphenols) may protect cells from free radicals and thus helps to slow down the ageing processReduced phosphorus content supports kidney functionsAn adapted protein content (25%) helps to maintain muscle massKibble:,39.99,horseandhound_128,Taste Of The Wild Wetlands Dry Dog Food 15lb,Taste of the Wild - Appalachian Valley Adult Small Breed is a balanced dry food for small breeds of dog of all ages.

0,bibita_278,Royal Canin Yorkshire Terrier Adult,Yorkshire Terriers are full of character and have beautiful grey-blue fur with a similar make-up to human hair. This Royal Canin Yorkshire Terrier Adult dry dog food has been designed to support the growth of this hair. This breed needs 35% protein in its food; a quantity that can be found in this dish. The Yorkshire Terrier also has no undercoat; meaning that the skin beneath reacts extremely sensitively to the slightest impact.Royal Canin Yorkshire Terrier Adult has been specially formulated to be ideal for small jaws and small tooth structure. This dog also sheds frequently; meaning it can often be picky about its food and requires something extra delicious to ensure it eats!This breed can have an impressive life expectancy; with vets and breeders reporting cases of 21 year lifespans. However; it is only natural that issues with joints or organs increase with age.This Royal Canin Yorkshire Terrier Adult takes care of these special needs and helps combat ageing:Delay of Ageing: anti-Oxidant complex protects your pet's long living cells from free radicals; a reduced sodium content protects the heart; a low phosphorous content relieves the kidneys. Chondroitin sulfate and Glucosamine; building blocks of protein; protect your terrier's joints.Tartar Prophylaxis:  Sodium phosphate intercepts the calcium in saliva; so that it cannot be used in the formation of tartar. The special size and texture of the kibble lead to optimized chewing and deep penetration into the teeth that gently; yet; abrasively cleans your pet's teeth.Radiant Fur and Healthy Skin: Borage oil and Biotin make your dog's fur softer and more radiant. The Intense Colour Complex supports the development of the steel blue-gray color. Sulphurous amino acids encourage the production of keratin; and supports the formation of the furHighest Absorption:  select nutrients ensure the highest absorption even for fussy dogsKibble:,8.79,bibita_315,Hill's Science Plan Puppy Healthy Development Medium - Chicken,HYPOALLERGENIC is a complete dietetic feed for dogs formulated to reduce ingredient and nutrient intolerances.

If you own a pug; you know that the breed makes a happy and lively companion. These dignified; contented little dogs also show a lot of courage and dignity. Their courage means that they can find it difficult to interpret signs of aggression in other dogs and underestimate danger. Its gentle nature makes the pug the perfect dog to keep with other pets. Pugs are prone to gaining excess weight; so it is important that you feed your dog a healthy; balanced diet. Their physiology; with short jaws (brachycephalic type); gives them narrowed airways; so they often have difficulty breathing and that can have a knock-on effect on their eating habits. Feeding can be difficult; so pugs need a special kibble that is easy to eat and encourages chewing.Royal Canin Breed Pug Adult was developed with the special requirements of pugs from 10 months in mind:Maintaining ideal weight: high-quality proteins and an increased amount of L-carnitine can help dogs with a tendency to put on too many pounds to keep their ideal weightOptimal food intake: a special kibble makes feeding easier and encourages intensive chewingSkin health and coat care: fish oil; vitamin A; borage oil; chelated zinc and a special skin nutrient complex strengthen the skin's barrier function and maintain the natural beauty of the coatSlowing down the ageing process: a select complex of anti-oxidants (vitamins E and C and polyphenols) can help to protect cells against free radicalsKibble:,16.49
